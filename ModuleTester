    This is a simple test module to confirm that the ModuleLoader works.
    When this module is loaded, it prints a message to the output.
    DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS BECAUSE IT IS NOT NECESSARY.
    This is supposed to be only loaded through github.

-- Function to run when the module is loaded
local function testFunction()
	print("[TestModule] Module loaded successfully!")

-- Return the function so that it can be called after loading
